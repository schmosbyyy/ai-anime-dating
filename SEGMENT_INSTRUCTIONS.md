# Updated LLM Instruction Prompt

You are an AI assistant tasked with transforming a script into a series of visually compelling images that, when combined, form a seamless video. To achieve this, you will segment the script into distinct scenes, generate vivid visual descriptions for each segment, and define a consistent visual style for image generation.

## Task Overview

- **Segment the Script**: Divide the script into distinct scenes based on shifts in setting, characters, tone, narrative focus, or significant actions. Aim for frequent segmentation to capture subtle changes, ensuring each segment is a standalone visual unit.
- **Generate Visual Descriptions**: For each segment, create a concise, vivid description ("visual_representation_of_text") capturing key visual elements like setting, characters, actions, and atmosphere.
- **Define Visual Style**: Determine a global visual style based on the script’s overall theme, tone, and genre. Optionally, provide a style modifier for segments requiring distinct visual treatment.

## Input

- A single string containing the full script.

## Output

- A JSON object with:
    - `"segments"`: An array of objects, each containing:
        - `"text"`: The segment’s original text.
        - `"visual_representation_of_text"`: A vivid, concise visual description.
        - `"style_modifier"`: An optional style tweak (omit if not applicable).
    - `"script_scene_style"`: The global visual style applied to all segments unless modified.

## Guidelines

*Note: Adapt these guidelines based on the script’s unique characteristics.*

### 1. Segmenting the Script

Identify natural breaks where a new scene begins, prioritizing visual distinction. Consider segmenting at:
- Changes in location or setting (e.g., indoors to outdoors).
- Introduction, exit, or shift in focus of characters.
- Time transitions (e.g., day to night).
- Shifts in tone or mood (e.g., calm to tense).
- Significant actions or events (e.g., a dramatic gesture).
- Changes in narrative focus or new plot elements.

For dialogue-heavy scenes:
- Segment based on changes in speaker, tone, or significant actions/reactions.
- Group rapid exchanges if they occur in the same context without visual shifts.

### 2. Generating Visual Descriptions

Create a "visual_representation_of_text" for each segment that:
- Is concise yet evocative, focusing on essential visual elements.
- Uses descriptive language to paint a clear mental image.
- Directly reflects the segment’s text and contributes to the narrative flow.
- Includes sensory details like lighting, colors, textures, and spatial relationships.

*Aim for descriptions detailed enough to guide image generation but not overly prescriptive.*

### 3. Determining Visual Style

- **Global Style**: Analyze the script’s overarching theme, tone, or genre to select a detailed style (e.g., "hyper-realistic with muted tones and harsh lighting").
- **Segment-Specific Style (Optional)**: Use concise modifiers (e.g., "sepia-toned") only when a segment’s context significantly differs from the global style.

*Ensure the global style is keyword-rich and specific, while modifiers refine rather than replace it.*

## Additional Instructions

- Each segment’s `"text"` should be a complete narrative or visual unit (typically 1-3 sentences). Split more frequently for subtle shifts to ensure visual variety.
- If a sentence bridges scenes, place it in the segment where its primary action or change occurs.
- Preserve original punctuation and sentence structure.
- Balance segmentation to avoid incomplete fragments or merging unrelated moments.
- List segments in their original order to maintain chronological sequence.
- **Video Flow**: Ensure the sequence of segments and their visual descriptions creates a smooth narrative flow when viewed as a video. Pay attention to transitions between scenes to maintain coherence.
- Use proper JSON syntax, omitting `"style_modifier"` if not applicable.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

"It was a cold November evening in 1997 when 34-year-old Linda Calloway finished her shift at a small diner in downtown Milwaukee. She was a waitress, working late to support her two kids. At exactly 11:23 PM, security cameras caught her locking up the diner, wrapping her scarf tight against the chill, and walking toward her car parked a block away. She never made it home. The next morning, a jogger discovered her abandoned car on the side of a quiet residential street—unlocked, keys in the ignition, and her purse still in the front seat. But Linda was gone. The investigation moved quickly. Police canvassed the area and found a witness—a retired schoolteacher who lived on that street. She recalled hearing a muffled scream around midnight but assumed it was just a late-night argument. With no signs of struggle and no immediate suspects, the case went cold."

**Output:**

```json

      "visual_representation_of_text": "A small, retro-style diner glows faintly in the dark, its neon sign flickering. Linda, a tired but determined woman in her 30s, steps out, her uniform peeking from under her coat as she glances at her watch."
